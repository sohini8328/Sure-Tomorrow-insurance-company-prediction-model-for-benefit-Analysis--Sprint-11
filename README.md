📊 Sure-Tomorrow-insurance-company-prediction-model-for-benefit-Analysis--Sprint-11
Overview
This project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of two models in predicting the number of customers who will receive insurance benefits:

A dummy model serving as a baseline.
A linear regression model trained on transformed data.
The goal is to determine which model provides more accurate predictions while ensuring data protection and maintaining model authenticity.

🔐 Data Protection & Integrity
Data Transformation & Recovery: The dataset underwent transformation and recovery processes to enhance model performance. Post-transformation results remained consistent, confirming the integrity of the data.
Security Measures: All data handling procedures were designed to prevent breaches and ensure compliance with data protection standards.
📈 Model Performance
Linear Regression Model
R² Score: 44%
Indicates that the model explains 44% of the variability in the target variable.

RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): 23%
Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors. A lower RMSE indicates better model accuracy.

Dummy Model
Used as a baseline for comparison. The linear regression model significantly outperformed the dummy model in predictive accuracy.

🧠 Additional Insights
Distance Metrics
Manhattan vs. Euclidean Distance:
Manhattan distance tends to be about 1.0 unit higher than Euclidean distance due to its grid-based path.
Manhattan distance is less sensitive to outliers, making it preferable for datasets with extreme values.
KNN Classifier
Data Scaling Impact:
The KNN classifier showed improved performance on scaled data, as indicated by a higher F1 score.
A higher F1 score reflects a better balance between precision and recall.
Weight Vector Equivalence
Predictions using weight vector wP are equivalent to those using w.
RMSE remains a key metric for evaluating prediction error—lower RMSE is better.
